        <h2>Descriptions</h2>
        <p>Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. The ingredients are stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution. An ideal use for leftovers, fried rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple to put together with whatever is in your fridge.</p>
        <p>Making fried rice is a breeze with the recipe you'll find below. The process is simple — preheat your pan before swirling in oil and aromatics, then add uncooked proteins if applicable. Add in rice and vegetables, vigorously tossing ingredients for that toasty, golden-brown color that signals big flavor.</p>
